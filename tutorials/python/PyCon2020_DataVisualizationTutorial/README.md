## About
From picking the right plot for the particular type of data, statistic, or result; to pre-processing sophisticated datasets, and even making important decisions about the aesthetic of a figure, visualization is both a science and art that requires both knowledge and practice to master.

This tutorial is for python users who are familiar with python and basic plotting, and want to build strong visualization skills that will let them effectively communicate any data, statistic, or result.

We will use python libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, and sklearn; and discuss topics such as density estimation, dimensionality reduction, exploring similar datasets, interactive plotting, and making suitable choices for communication. Drawing examples from datasets in the scientific, financial, geospatial (mapping) fields and more.

## Installation

In your terminal, run

```
git clone https://github.com/hsnee/PyCon2020_DataVisualizationTutorial.git
```

to download the content of this tutorial.

After that, you can run
```cd PyCon2020_DataVisualizationTutorial
jupyter notebook Effective_Data_Visualization_Workbook.ipynb
```
This assumes you have a Python version >3.7 and Jupyter installed. If not, an easy way to get this with most of the libraries needed for the tutorial is to install the latest https://anaconda.com distribution for your system, or to simply just visit https://bit.ly/PyConViz20 for a Google Colab-hosted version of this tutorial (or https://bit.ly/PyConViz20Full for the full version with all the solutions).

## Acknowledgement
A lot of people have helped shape my understanding of data visualization throughout the years, either throughout conversations with them, being directly taught by them, or being influenced by their work. I am indebted to the [LSSTC Data Science Fellowship Program](http://astrodatascience.org) (in particular, Adam Miller and Lucianne Walkowicz), Jake Vanderplas, Skipper Seabold, and to many helpful comments and discussions throughout the years by my supervisor Rachel Mandelbaum.
