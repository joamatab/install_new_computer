# Lumerical

## License server

You can install the license server

`make license`

https://support.lumerical.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024804834-FlexLM-configuration

### Control access

OPTIONS file, allows us to control access to license features
`sudo vi /opt/lumerical/lumerical-flexlm/licenses/LUMERICL/LUMERICL.opt`
https://kb.lumerical.com/en/index.html?install_flexnet_adv_restrict_user_access.html

- using the TIMEOUT / TIMEOUTALL option to specifically timeout and return a license feature or all licenses, when there is no activity between the client and the license manager. Timing out and automatically closing down unused GUIs? So we donâ€™t have to haunt designers who left the GUI open
- RESERVE option allows to allocate license to a user, group of users or hosts/client computers.

We reserve a GUI so we can run a script .lsf file, since the script interpreter is part of the GUI, as described in this video:

### Reserve licenses

```
GROUP test ubuntu centos

RESERVE 1 FDTD_Solutions_design GROUP test
RESERVE 1 MODE_Solutions_design GROUP test
```

### TIMEOUT licenses

For the TIMEOUT / TIMEOUTALL options you can use

```
TIMEOUT FDTD_Solutions_design 900
```

Checks FDTD CAD every 900 secs, then it will check-in / return the license

```
TIMEOUTALL 900
```

This second option checks all of the licenses every 900 secs and returns those that do not have active communication with the license manager

```
TIMEOUT FDTD_Solutions_design 900
TIMEOUT MODE_Solutions_design 900
TIMEOUT layout_ide 900
TIMEOUT Lumerical_INTERCONNECT_design  900
TIMEOUTALL 900
```
