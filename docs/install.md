# Run install script

What does it do?

- configures git user and SSH key
- install python3


What does that line do?

TODO:

- remove shared ssh key for cluster: write key collector on the cluster, that collects public keys over http to grant access
- write startup scripts that get script updates: so when you boot your machine you install the latest updates of this or other repo
